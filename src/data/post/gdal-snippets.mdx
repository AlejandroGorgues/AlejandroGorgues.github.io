GDAL is one of the most known software library for raster and vector geospatial treatment.
Multiple formats from the geospatial field can be used, and a lot of the geospatial sofware has GDAL below because it's simplicity
and powerfulness.

However, as on many of the cases, when things get complicated, you have to look for, and there is not so much
documentation to understand how to use it. In this post I will try to write some of those cases that helped me
along my work.

## Reproject raster with longitude that goes from (0,360) to (-180,180) degrees[^1]
```bash
# Description:
# raster lat: (-90,90)
# raster lon: (-0,360)
# raster projection: WGS84
# CENTER_LONG: 0 to force rewrapping around new central longitude
# SOURCE_EXTRA: 1000 to add extra data on longitude limits to prevent gap generation
gdalwarp -s_srs "+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84" -t_srs WGS84 input.tif output.tif -wo SOURCE_EXTRA=1000 --config CENTER_LONG 0
```
