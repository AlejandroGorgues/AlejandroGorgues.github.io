## Hover to affect other element (even if it is not a child)
Imagine that you have a set of buttons and a list of words, and once you hover over a button,
the words that are the same on the list changed it's color.

One could think to do it by JavaScript triggers, 
but with CSS there is a possibility to implement this functionality.

To make it possible, we need to have each button defined with it's own id, an each word also with a recognizable id or class.

Once we know everything, we can implement the solution as mentioned in the [article](https://vibrantwebs.medium.com/css-hover-to-affect-other-element-even-if-other-element-is-not-a-child-4f9ccf54bb5c)
written by [Andrew Musholt](https://vibrantwebs.medium.com/).
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
    <title>Browser</title>
</head>

<body>
    <div id="buildings"><h3>Buildings</h3></div>
    <div id="colours"><h3>Colours</h3></div>

    <ul>
        <li class="building">House</li>
        <li class="building">Skyscrapper</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li class="colour">Red</li>
        <li class="colour">Blue</li>
    </ul>
</body>

</html>
```
```css
body:has(#buildings:hover) .building {
  background-color: green;
}
```
> This works because every element has **body** as the parent of both the list and the div.

## Override element.style using CSS
Sometimes when you import an style you did not developed, you want to change
specific elements without modifying their associated style, and when you do it, turns out it does not update it.

Although isn't a good practice, one solution could be to override it. 

Explained in the [Mozilla docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/important), 
when can see also a clear example [answered](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14910608/override-element-style-using-css) in StackOverflow by [DiscoInfiltrator](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2029085/discoinfiltrator),
where by using the `!important` variable after the property value, the property is override by the one defined here.
```css
li {
    display: inline !important;
}
``` 
In this case, the display would be override to use the inline value.
