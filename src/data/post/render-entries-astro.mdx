At some point during my blog development I asked myself how to render programatically through jsx.
By thinking and looking at the StackOverflow forum, I found out an [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78627256/how-to-render-multiple-content-entries-from-getcollection-in-astro) 
written by [Soviut](https://stackoverflow.com/users/46914/soviut) who made it easily to implement.

First of all, we need to import the render.
```astro
---
import { render } from 'astro:content';
---
```
Then, if we want to render multiple items, we can do it inside the jsx brackets, otherwise, just by
wrapping it in jsx curly brackets would be enough.
```jsx
<ul>
  {
    contents.map(async (c) => {
      const { Content } = await c.render()
      return (
        <li>
          <Content />
        </li>
      )
    })
  }
</ul>
```
