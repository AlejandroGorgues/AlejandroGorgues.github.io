Astro works easily with [markdown files](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/). You just need to define some frontmatter data to identify metadata for each item, 
and write the main content to be rendered in the body of the file.

However, what if you want to render part of the frontmatter data as Markdown as well?. For example, say you have a list of blog posts and want to display not just the main content, 
but also a Markdown-formatted description. 
Since this description comes from a data source that Astro doesn't automatically render as Markdown, it's treated as plain text.

Thanks to the modularization architecture of Astro, through the post written by [James Midzi](https://dantedecodes.vercel.app/articles/rendering-external-markdown-in-astro-46oj/),
I found out [astro-remote](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-remote).

**Astro-remote** is a small utility that lets you render arbitrary Markdown content with full control, much like you would with components on a page.

For my case, if I want to render a post's description just like its main content, all I need to do is use the `<Markdown>` component
and thats it!
```jsx
---
import {Markdown } from "astro-remote";
---
//...//
{description && <Markdown content={description}/>}
//...//
```
The main problem was solved, but a second one appeared.

As text might contain inline code, and because standard Markdown doesn't style it by default, 
I needed to apply custom CSS to make it look properly formatted. 
The problem was that the CSS styles relied on specific tags, classes, or IDs, which weren't present in the rendered output,
requiring to create a convoluted CSS selectors or modifying the DOM after rendering â€” neither of which was ideal.

However, from many of the cool features of the **astro-remote** libray, one of them is the possibility of modifying the markdown render output through
an Astro component.

1. First, I changed the markdown to be able to pass the output into a custom component (remember to enable component integration through the **satinize** property).
```jsx
---
import {Markdown } from "astro-remote";
import PostDescription from "../components/PostDescription.astro";
---
//...//
{description && <Markdown content={description} sanitize={{ allowComponents: true }} components={{PostDescription}} />}
//...//
```
2. Then inside the frontmatter attribute I included the text inside the tag.
```markdown
description: <PostDescription>On my blog development...</PostDescription>
```
3. And at the end, I created the component.
```astro
---
---
<div >
    <p class="rich-text">
        <slot />
    </p>
</div>
<style>
p:empty {
  display: none;
}
</style>
```
> The `p:empty` condition is added due to remove the double `p` tag that Astro generate to render it, which hinders the solution.
<br />
> For the case, it might be an overkill, but for the time, was the one that gives the easiest implementation.
