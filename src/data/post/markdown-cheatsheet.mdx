## White spaces in markdown
If you want to add horizontal white space equivalent you can add different HTML entities before or between the phrase
as mentioned in the StackOverflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57057458) written by [Janosh](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4034025/janosh):
* `&nbsp;` for basic white space.
* `&ensp;` for white space equivalent to N letter.
* `&emsp;` for white space equivalent to M letter.
* `&thinsp;` for a smaller white space.

```markdown
<!-- You can stack as many html entities as you want.
For example, This add three spaces to the left.-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example text.
```
Take into account that except for `&nbsp;` all entities allow to be broken if content is above the container size.
