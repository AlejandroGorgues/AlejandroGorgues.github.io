HTML environment is huge enough to get lost at the amount of documentation, tutorials, frameworks and libraries.

As title says, this post it's about HTML, and what I want to show to you all are concepts that I may found useful 
to prevent using frameworks or wrappers that complicates it's understanding to the developer.

## Types of lists
Defined in Mozilla docs, as far as I know there are three tags we can use based on the type of information
that we have with us.

### Unordered lists[^1]
When we want to visualize elements from a list that may not have an specific order (much like simple visualization), 
we can use the `<ul>...</ul>` tag like in the example below.
```html
<ul>
 <li>Orange</li>
 <li>Apple</li>
 <li>Watermelon</li>
</ul>
```
### Ordered lists[^2]
When we want to show a set of things (actions, etc.) that comes in order, the `<ol>...</ol>` tag is used.
```html
<ol>
 <li>Wake up</li>
 <li>Take a shower</li>
 <li>Eat breakfast</li>
</ol>
```
### Description lists[^3]
When we want to show a set of terms with it's respective description, we could use the `<dl>...</dl>` tag.
```html
<dl>
 <dt>House</dt>
 <dd>A building</dd>
 <dt>Bycicle</dt>
 <dd>A means of transport</dd>
 <dt>Water</dt>
 <dd>A chemical compound</dd>
</dl>
```
